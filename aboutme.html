<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>

I am an undergraduate at the University of Missouri

I study Biology and Psychology.

I also work at the MU Career Center as a Career Specialist and supervisor and for Cytive Lyfe Sciences as a Undergradute Campus Representative. I really like dogs, so I have attached a photo of my favorite type of dog, a goldendoodle.<br>
